***

It is always good to go back to basics and revisit old concepts to rectify the fading concepts in our memory. In a similar attempt, I am going to make notes for my revisit to old concepts. The notes are made from [Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow **by Aurélien Géron**](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/).

> These notes are in no means replacement to the awesome book. These can be used as a companion or as revision guide.
